# a-beats-tech
to sell BCA level projects.
This project is known as A-beats tech. Its goal is to sell web-based projects to BCA students. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, bootstrap, jquery, and node.js were the technologies I used in this project.I use Mailgun to send user feedback to the website's owner, which is me, and I host this project on Heroku. The website address is https://abeats.herokuapp.com/.
